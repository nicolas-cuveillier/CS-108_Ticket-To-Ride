     * <p>
     * Then, in the while loop, all the game takes place : the current player choose the kind of turn he wants
     * (draw tickets, draw cards, claim route). if he draw tickets, he will have to choose the one he keep. If he draw
     * cards, he can draw a card from the faceUpCards or the blind top deck card two times. If he try to claim a Route,
     * it will depends on the route's level. For underground Route, he will have to play additional cards or abandon.
     * At every step, information will be display.
     * <p>
     * Finally, after the while loop, final points for each player will be computed and the winner (or winners)
     * will be computed and information will be displayed.
